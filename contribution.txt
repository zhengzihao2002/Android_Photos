Yiming Huang: Tested the application and made sure it ran normally on his laptop. If it didn't, such as encountered a bug, Zihao would be notified to fix the bug. Contributed two obsolete XML files (eventually not considered in the project)

Zihao Zheng: Did everything else, such as writing the code, tested for bugs, removed all bugs, taught Yiming how to start writing in android studio, etc. 




The overall contribution is calculated by:
- Code : 99%
- Bug Testing : 1%
